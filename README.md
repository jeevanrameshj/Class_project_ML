Please run the Main_code.mlx file while all 81 files stored in the one folder (in the MATLAB working directory) The code will take each dataset (for each subject and each activity), and will perform set of functions: outlier removal, noise removal,( detrending bandpass filtering 4-100Hz bandpass filtering 57-63Hz), feature calculation. Then 37 features will be calculated for per signal (4x11x3 = 132 signals in total where 4 is the # of electrodes, 11 is the # of subjects, and 3 is the # of activities)
